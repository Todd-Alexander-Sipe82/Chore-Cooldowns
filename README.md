**Chore Cooldown Program**

Inspired by skill rotation cooldowns in many video games, this program is intended to track completed chores by assigning a "cooldown" to them, and tracking when the last time the chore was done.

Currently, the program prioritizes bigger cooldowns (a chore that only needs to be done every 28 days) over smaller cooldowns (a chore that only has a cooldown of 1 day).

**Plans for initial improvement are:**
- Giving a priority rating to all chores, superseding the cooldown value.
- Adding a 'cycle' option to skip the suggested chore and do another.
- Adding a way to check off a chore specifically by name.
- Because of the above, a way to list out all chores and associated information.

This project was done for fun.

The motivation behind this comes from my responsibilities as I attended school. I worked out a deal with my partner that I would be responsible for the household chores whilst attending school full time. My struggles to find a good system to track my progress, and approach of "bottom up", or in other words, daily>weekly>monthly often lead to the situation where the monthly chores were not getting done.
